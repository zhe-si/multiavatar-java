[Multiavatar](https://multiavatar.com) is a multicultural avatar generator.

In total, it is possible to generate **12,230,590,464** cryptographically unique avatars.

Initially coded in JavaScript, this version of Multiavatar is re-created in Java.

For more details about the Multiavatar Generator, please refer to the readme available in the JS [repository](https://github.com/multiavatar/Multiavatar).


### Installation ###

Install Multiavatar with pip:

`pip install multiavatar`

Import Multiavatar in your Python code:

`from multiavatar.multiavatar import multiavatar`


### Usage ###

```
svgCode = multiavatar("Binx Bond", None, None);
print(svgCode)
```

For advanced usage, pass boolean `True` as the second parameter if you wish to generate an avatar without the environment part.

Pass a dictionary as the third parameter to generate a specific avatar version.

```
avatarId = "ANY_STRING"
svgCode = multiavatar(avatarId, True, { "part": "11", "theme": "C" })
```


### Testing ###

To catch bugs, the representation of tests should be visual because not all bugs have programmatic errors. For example, if an equal length color array is mixed, or a double semicolon appears in a color string, in such cases an error is not thrown, but the visual representation of avatar(-s) becomes broken.

There are two types of tests, currently available in `index.html` and `other.html` files. Simply open these files in your browser. Build these files by running the Python build scripts in the `tests` folder.

In the `index.html` file, visually presented are all 48 base versions or avatars. If all 48 base versions are good, then it means that all 12 billion are also good, because the 12 billion are constructed from different parts of the 48 base versions. All avatars in this file should look exactly the same as in the JavaScript repository's `\svg\index.html` file.

In the `other.html` file, additional various tests are performed to test different approaches how to generate avatars, specific avatar versions, or some repository-specific cases.


### API ###

Alternatively to this Python script, you can use Multiavatar through the web API.

```
https://api.multiavatar.com/Binx Bond
```

To get an avatar as SVG file, add .svg to the end of the URL:

```
https://api.multiavatar.com/Binx Bond.svg
```
To get an avatar as PNG file, add .png to the end of the URL:

```
